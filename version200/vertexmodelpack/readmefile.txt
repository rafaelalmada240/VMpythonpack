notes on vertexmodelpack
function modules:
- connections: functions for adjusting networks and finding neighbourhoods of elements in the network
- geomproperties: functions for geometrical properties of the network
- randomlattice: functions for the random generation of center distributions that will give rise to the network
- sppvertex: dynamic functions for the vertex model energy functional implementation
- topologicaltransitions: functions for topological transitions in the network
- weightedgraphanalysis: functions for spectral properties of network (as of yet not necessary)
- readTissueFiles: functions to open and save data from tissue generation and visualization
- movies_from_plots: functions that help to create visualization from simulation outputs.
