# Function modules:

## Core function modules
- **randomlattice**: functions for the random generation of center distributions that will give rise to the network
- **connections**: functions for adjusting networks and finding neighbourhoods of elements in the network
- **sppvertex**: dynamic functions for the vertex model energy functional implementation
- **topologicaltransitions**: functions for topological transitions in the network

## Auxilliary function modules
- geomproperties: functions for geometrical properties of the network
- dynamicalanalysis: Auxiliary functions for data analysis of simulation outputs
- woundclosureanalysis: Auxilliary functions for data analysis and wound closure behavior classification.

## I/O module
- readTissueFiles: functions to open and save data from tissue generation and visualization
